  signup.html page:

	The form is validated through javascript; in the same function, I save data into a 
   cookie which will be used in order to obtain user information  on the quiz pages.
	In the form, the Name and the Email are required to be entered (they are starred).
	The email, postal code and birthdate are checked for validity.
	
  quiz pages (file1.html, file2.html, file3.html):
  
	All of the body's div's are placed within a 'bodycontainer' class. The class 'hidden'
	is used in order to keep content hidden until it is required.
	When the user clicks the Start Quiz button, new content will show up (setting the
	class of that content to a 'visible' class.
	
	The timers start once the Start Quiz button is clicked. There are 3 question timers;
	each one keeps track of how long a user stayed on each of the 3 questions. The times
	are also reported when the results of the quiz are shown.
	
	The questions are navigable by the 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons, which are disabled
	appropriately so the user knows the limits of the questions. 
	
	When the user clicks the submit button, the quiz will be submitted, whether or not
	the user answered all the questions. The results will show the correct/incorrect and 
	unanswered questions.
	
	If any of the pages are accessed without the user being logged in, the quiz will not
	be displayed. A register link will be available for the guest to sign up.
	
	(The answers of each quiz might not be correct, they are always 2,4,2 or b,d,b).
